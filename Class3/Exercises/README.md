## EXERCISES I DID FROM CLASS 3 

Here you can see my solution to the exercises I had to do for class 3.

- **Exercicio6.java** and **Wins.java** need each other since I did it as a OOP by instinct, but I've fixed this to a simpler way as the professor asked, you can see the "fixed" one if you see the **Exercicio_6.java** file.
