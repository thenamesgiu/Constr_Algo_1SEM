## EXAMPLES FROM CLASS3

When navigating through this repository it's possible to see examples given during the third class of Algorithm Building from my college.

- We're currently using **Apache NetBeans** to program and yeah, I can only use Java by now.

- This class was cool, as always. Sometimes it gets really boring to see everything from the start, but it's always good to have a recall;

- I guess the only new thing to me was the **formatting output**, I used Java before but never really got to understand how this formatting thing works, now that I know it seems **simple and better** than concatenate variables one by one.
