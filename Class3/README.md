## CLASS 3 OF ALGORITHM BUILDING

This is the repo for the third class of Algorithm Building from my college, I'm currently in my Junior years. We're using Apache Netbeans, it's Java time.

## What was this about?
- How to comment your code (as in most languages, we use // and /* */);
- Indentation (apparently there's a shortcut for this in NetBeans: ALT + SHIFT + F);
- Arithmetic Operators (as always +, -, *, /, %, -- and ++);
- Output (diferences between println, print and intro to printf);
- Special caracters (\n, \t, \ two times, \");
- Formatting output (%d, %f, %2f, %b, %c, %s);
- String concatenating;
- Input, importing java.util.Scanner package, declaring Scanner and its object;
- How to use Scanner;
- Exercises

### What did i learned from this?

- I know how to use the formatting output stuff now, and there's a way to limit numbers when using a float variable (%.2f);
- I did OOP by instinct, had to re-do Exercise 6.
