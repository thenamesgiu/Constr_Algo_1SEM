## CLASS 7 OF ALGORITHM BUILDING
When navigating through this repository it's possible to see examples given during the third class of Algorithm Building from my college.

-We're currently using Apache NetBeans to program and yeah, I can only use Java by now.
- I hated switch case back in C# and Portugol, but here I actually changed my mind, practice makes it easier.
- And there we go using do while and while again...it used to be my worst nightmare.
