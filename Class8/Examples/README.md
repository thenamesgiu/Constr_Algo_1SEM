CLASS 8 OF ALGORITHM BUILDING
When navigating through this repository it's possible to see examples given during the third class of Algorithm Building from my college.

- We're currently using Apache NetBeans to program and yeah, I can only use Java by now.
- I'm familiar with vectors from C#, so it wasn't hard.
