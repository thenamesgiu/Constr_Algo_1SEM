## CLASS 9 OF ALGORITHM BUILDING
When navigating through this repository it's possible to see examples given during the third class of Algorithm Building from my college.

- We're currently using Apache NetBeans to program and yeah, I can only use Java by now.
- I'll consider this class as a recall just like all the other classes;
- Even though matrix in Java is kind of different from the ones we use in C#, it was quite familiar.
