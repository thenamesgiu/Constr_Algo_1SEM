## CLASS 6 OF ALGORITHM BUILDING
When navigating through this repository it's possible to see examples given during the third class of Algorithm Building from my college.

- We're currently using Apache NetBeans to program and yeah, I can only use Java by now.
- We got introduced to switch in Java, it looked way easier, there wasn't much since we presented our project before the actual class.
