# Constr_Algo_1SEM Repo

This repository contains code from my college discipline (Algorithm Building) from the 1st Semester. 

Since it's the beginning of the graduation, we're learning the **basics** about programming, it might be really naive if you look through, but it is what it is, soon it will get more complex.

- We're using Java, the IDE is Apache NetBeans.
