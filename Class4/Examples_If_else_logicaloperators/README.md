## CLASS 3 OF ALGORITHM BUILDING

When navigating through this repository it's possible to see examples given during the third class of Algorithm Building from my college.

- We're currently using Apache NetBeans to program and yeah, I can only use Java by now.

- This class was cool, as always. Sometimes it gets really boring to see everything from the start, but it's always good to have a recall;

- The only thing I've learned that's actually new to me is the variable.equals(argument) you need to use when the condition has a String.
